<p class="fs-4 ms-0 mb-4 page-description">
Review changes in Material Style source files, documentation, and components to 
migrate from v2 to v3.
</p>

## **v3.1.0-alpha2**
*Based on Bootstrap v5.3.1*

### Docs
Added documentation for Layout, Utilities & Helpers

### Forms
Text and Select Fields now use the global `border-width` & `border-radius`

### Theming
We have created <a class="link-pink" href="https://materialstyle.github.io/theme-builder">Theme builder</a>, 
a tool for customizing Material Style. With this tool, you can effortlessly select your theme color, 
set the global `border-width`, and adjust `border-radius`. The tool offers real-time previews on components, making it 
easy to visualize your design choices. Additionally, it automatically generates **CSS variables** based on your 
theme color selection.

## **v3.1.0-alpha1**
*Based on Bootstrap v5.3.0-alpha3*

**Follows the following Bootstrap migration guides:**

### Customization
#### Color modes
- Material Style supports Light and Dark color modes. See [the color modes documentation]({{< docsref "/colors/color-modes" >}}) to learn more.
- Theme colors are adaptive to Light and Dark modes by default.

#### Theming
Theme colors can be customized using CSS variables. And the components are updated to use theme colors from the CSS variables. It allows for custom theming using CSS variables. Helpful for CDN users. See [theming]({{< docsref "/colors/theming" >}}) to learn more.

#### Colors
- <span class="badge text-bg-danger rounded-pill me-1">Breaking</span> 
Colors `red`, `pink`, `purple`, `indigo`, `blue`, `cyan`, `teal`, `green`, `yellow` & `orange`
have been removed in favour of custom theming.

## **v3.0.0**

### **Utilities**
#### Colors
- <span class="badge text-bg-danger rounded-pill me-1">Breaking</span> 
To avoid increased file sizes, v3 uses only a subset of the v2 color palette. 
It uses Bootstrap's default theme colors + pink, purple, indigo, teal, orange, white & black.
- <span class="badge text-bg-danger rounded-pill me-1">Breaking</span> 
Color shades (Example: ```red-50```, ```blue-500```, ```pink-a100```) have been removed to 
reduce file size.

#### Ripple
- v3 uses the official Material Design Ripple package 
<a class="link-pink" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@material/ripple">@material/ripple</a>
for the ripple effects.
- <span class="badge text-bg-danger rounded-pill me-1">Breaking</span> Unlike v2, where the ripple effect is directly 
applied to components, in v3, we need to add an element 
```<span class="ripple-surface"></span>``` to the desired component like a Button and activate 
the effect on the ```ripple-surface```.
