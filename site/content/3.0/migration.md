<p class="fs-4 ms-0 mb-4 text-secondary migration-intro">
Material Style 3 is a major rewrite of the entire project.
</p>

Follows <a class="link-pink" href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/migration/">Bootstrap v5 migration guide</a>.

## **Utilities**
### Colors
To avoid increased file sizes, now we only use a subset of the v2 color palette.

### Ripple
Unlike v2, where the ripple effect can be activated just by calling the JS function, 
in v3, we need to add an element with the class ```.ripple-surface``` to the desired element.

### Shadows
- Shadow classes ```.raised-*dp``` has been renamed to ```.shadow-*dp```
- Class ```.unelevated``` has been replaced with ```.shadow-none```

## **Components**
### Buttons
- Classes ```btn-text-[color]``` have been dropped. ```btn-outline-[color] border-0``` can be used for Text Buttons.
- File inputs now use Bootstrap's default styling. Classes ```m-file-input``` and ```btn-file``` have been dropped.
