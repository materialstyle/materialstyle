Material Style 3 is a major rewrite of the entire project. The most notable changes are 
summarized below.
</p>

**Follows <a class="link-pink" href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/migration/">Bootstrap v5 migration guide</a>.**

## **Utilities**
### Colors
- <span class="badge bg-danger rounded-pill me-1">Breaking</span> 
To avoid increased file sizes, v3 uses only a subset of the v2 color palette. 
It uses Bootstrap's default theme colors + pink, purple, indigo, teal, orange, white & black.
- <span class="badge bg-danger rounded-pill me-1">Breaking</span> 
Color shades (Example: ```red-50```, ```blue-500```, ```pink-a100```) have been removed to 
reduce file size.

### Ripple
- v3 uses the official Material Design Ripple package 
<a class="link-pink" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@material/ripple">@material/ripple</a>
for the ripple effects.
- <span class="badge bg-danger rounded-pill me-1">Breaking</span> Unlike v2, where the ripple effect is directly 
applied to components, in v3, we need to add an element 
```<span class="ripple-surface"></span>``` to the desired component like a Button and activate 
the effect on the ```ripple-surface```.
